This web page was designed as a personal portfolio to show off all of the project I make (this page it's self kid of doubled that number).

I also made this page as a way for me to get some practice using react which I've been learning.

# Development Environment

In making this web page I programed entirely in VSCode, and got a lot of help from ChatGPT.

As far as programming languages go I used JavaScriptXML, CSS, and HTML
# Useful Websites

I ripped off the design choices from Isaac Gluck's personal website. I didn't copy or even look at any of his code, but I stole the look of his website.
